A simple programme, written in c++ to guide a user through a step by step process in creating a buffer overflow exploit for a given application.

To begin with (in no particular order):

1. Consider questions which would need to be asked
2. Identify dependencies (such as msfvenom)
3. Consider limitations
4. Create an application which works well on a particular vulnerable programme (I am aware that the OSCP contains an example based on syncbreeze 10.0.28 - perhaps this would be an appropriate place to start).
5. Test and expand the application to work on other programmes
6. Identify areas of future expansion - fuzzing script generator? All-in-one shell generator?
